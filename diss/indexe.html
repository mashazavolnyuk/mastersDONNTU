<p class="TitleBio" id="goal">Aim and research tasks</p>
<p class="textAbstract">The aim of this work is to study and evaluation of algorithms for solving one-dimensional problems of resource allocation.
To achieve this goal the following tasks: review of existing algorithms and methods
their decisions and to assess on the computational complexity</p>

<p class="TitleBio" id="actual">Relevance of the topic</p>
<p class="textAbstract">Relevance of the topic is the need to study scientific approaches to determine the optimal allocation of resources in terms of needs.</p>

<p class="TitleBio" id="titleOne">CLASSIFICATION resource allocation problem (ZLP)</p>

<p class="TitleBio" id="partOneOne">1.1 General concepts of resource allocation and classification of problems  </p>

<p class="textAbstract">Resource allocation problems - the problem of efficient use of limited resources
         or such use that best promotes a particular purpose.
    The objectives of this class occur when the available resources are not sufficient to perform each job
         the most effective way. In practice, very often multi-stage operations related to the reasonable
         the distribution of those or other resources. It is about the allocation of funds, materials, labor force
         businesses industries or individual stages of work, the distribution of ammunition for the purposes of the total weight G,
         allotted to a technical device in his separate units, and so on. d. - generally about distribution all possible means
         for some categories of events.</p>

<p class="textAbstract">Theoretically, distribution tasks can be divided into the following groups:</p>

<p class="textAbstract"> 1. Define the resources and work. Required to allocate resources between the works in such a
    way as to maximize the effectiveness of a particular criterion (eg profit)
    or minimize the costs (production costs). Example. Known production targets and production capacity.
    When there are different ways of manufacturing products (such as processing on different machines) limit
         capacity does not allow for each product to use the best technology.
    What methods of production need to select to perform tasks with minimal cost?</p>

<p class="textAbstract"> 2. Set only work.Required to pick up those resources that enable
         perform them with minimal production costs. Example. Known monthly timetable
         passenger aircraft for airlines. How many crews needed
         to perform the transportation plan with minimal operating costs.</p>

<p class="textAbstract"> 3. Set the only resources available. It is required to determine what work can be done with
         these resources to provide maximum efficiency. Example. Set by the company with certain
         production, material and labor resources. Select a range of manufactured products,
         which will ensure maximum profit.
    Most often in practice there are problems of the first type. Resource allocation problems are problems of line
         programming.</p>

<p class="TitleBio" id="partOneTwo">1.2 The mathematical model of the problem of resource allocation</p>

<p class="textAbstract">Linear programming - mathematical discipline,
         dedicated to the theory and methods for solving extremal problems on sets of N-dimensional vector space,
         defined systems of linear equations and inequalities. </p>

<p class="textAbstract">To construct a mathematical model of linear programming problems must perform
         next steps:</p>

<p class="textAbstract">1. Identify the variables of the problem.</p>

<p class="textAbstract">2. Create constraints to be satisfied by the unknown variables.</p>

<p class="textAbstract">3. Be objective function.</p>

<p class="textAbstract">Linear programming problem (ZLP), which is formulated in general terms as:</p>

<div class="imgCenter"><img src="img/formula.png" class="imageAbstract"></div>
<p class="textAbstract">with restrictions:</p>

<div class="imgCenter"><img src="img/formula2.png" class="imageAbstract"></div>
<p class="textAbstract">where</p>

<p class="textAbstract">aij – the coefficients of the variables;</p>

<p class="textAbstract">bj – limitations in terms of resources.</p>

<p class="textAbstract">The objective function of the optimization problem is reduced
         a linear function of n variables x1, x2, .. n.</p>

<p class="textAbstract">The system of restrictions in expanded form is written as:</p>

<div class="imgCenter"><img src="img/formula3.png" class="imageAbstract"></div>

<p class="TitleBio" id="titleTwo">METHODS OF DECISION-dimensional problems</p>

<p class="TitleBio" id="partTwoOne">Graphical method</p>

<p class="textAbstract">Graphic method for solving linear programming problems based on geometrical
         interpretation
         linear programming problem, and it is used mainly for solving the two-dimensional space and
         Only some of the problems of three-dimensional space, as rather difficult to construct a polyhedron solutions
         which is formed by the intersection of half-spaces.The problem space of dimension greater than three
         picture
         graphically impossible</p>

<p class="textAbstract">Let a linear programming problem is given in a two-dimensional space, there are restrictions
        It contains two variables.
         Find the minimum value of the function Z = c1x1 + c2x2 under the constraints of the form:</p>
<div class="imgCenter"><img src="img/grafMetod.png" class="imageAbstract"></div>
<p class="textAbstract"> Assume that the system is sharing. Each of the inequalities of the system and determines
         half-plane with boundary lines:
    a<sub>i1</sub>x<sub>1</sub>+a<sub>i2</sub>x<sub>2</sub>=b<sub>i</sub>,(i=1,2..n);x<sub>1</sub>=0;x<sub>2</sub>=0
    Linear function with fixed values is a straight line equation:c<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub>+
    c<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub>=const; </p>

<p class="textAbstract">We construct a polygon solutions of linear constraints and schedule functions at Z = 0.

<p class="textAbstract"> Then the task of linear programming can give the following
         interpretation:</p>

<p class="textAbstract">Find polygon point solutions which direct c<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub>+
    c<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub>=const; Z reference function thus reaches a minimum.</p>

<p class="textAbstract">Value c<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub>+
    c<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub>=Z decrease in the direction of the vector N=(-c<sub>1</sub>,-c<sub>2</sub>),
    so straight Z = 0 we move parallel to itself in the direction of N.</p>

<p class="textAbstract">If a polygon making limited (Figure 2.1)
         the straight line becomes twice the reference with respect to the polygon solutions (points B and E),
         Moreover, the minimum value takes at E. The coordinates of the point is, solving the system of equations of lines and DE</p>
<div class="imgCenter"><img src="img/grafMetod2.png" class="imageAbstract"></div>
<p class="textAbstract">Figure 2.1 - Example of graphical solution of linear programming problem 6
         conditions.</p>

<p class="TitleBio" id="partTwoTwo">Simplex method </p>

<p class="textAbstract">The simplex method is a basic linear programming.
         Solution of the problem begins with a look at one of the vertices of conditions.
    If the test does not match the peak of the maximum (minimum), then go to a nearby,
         increasing the value of the objective function for solving the problem on the maximum and reducing the solution of the problem to a minimum.
    Thus, the transition from one node to another to improve the objective function. Since the number of vertices
         polyhedron is limited,
         the finite number of steps guaranteed to find the optimal value, or the establishment of the fact,
         that the problem is unsolvable.</p>

<p class="textAbstract">Calculations of the simplex method are organized as simplex tables
         which is shorthand linear programming problem in canonical form.
         Before drawing up the simplex table task must be transformed, reduced to a system of constraints
         allowable baseline mean, c by which the function of the target should be excluded basic variables.</p>

<p class="textAbstract">To compile simplex tables in all equations in the problem members,
         comprising the variables are transferred to the left side, the right free retained,
         ie problem is written as a system of equations (Figure 2.2).</p>

<div class="imgCenter"><img src="img/simplMetod.png" class="imageAbstract"></div>
<p class="textAbstract"> Further, this system takes the form of the simplex table (Figure 2.3).</p>

<p class="textAbstract" id="partTwoThree">Exhaustive search (or "brute force") - a method of solving the problem by trying all
         options.</p>

<p class="textAbstract" id="partTwoFour">Genetic algorithms have been proposed by John Henry Holland in 1970 and belong to the so-
         metaalgoritmam called.
         The idea - Preparation of search algorithms based on biological models of the mechanisms of natural selection.
         The basic concepts are: population, selection, mutation, crossover.</p>

<p class="textAbstract">Population. It comprises a set of binary strings (chromosomes), possible solutions.
         On the basis of the first ("old") populations build a second ("new") population of solutions,
         which serves as the "old" for a third of the population, etc.</p>

<p class="textAbstract">Tackling. Sets the selection function, according to which the best representatives of the "old" population
         selected for the reproduction of the "new."
         Therefore, the algorithm selects the best solution.</p>

<p class="textAbstract">Crossbreeding. For a pair of rows ("parents") with a certain length r is chosen arbitrary number
         1 <= s <= r.
         "Parents" exchanged between the bits with s + 1 to r-th and obtained two new lines ("offspring")</p>

<p class="textAbstract">
    Mutation. The changes taking place with a certain probability.</p>

<p class="textAbstract"> The picture shows all the steps of the algorithm:</p>

<p class="textAbstract">1. Create random population of binary chromosomes.</p>

<p class="textAbstract"> 2. Evaluation of each number.</p>

<p class="textAbstract">3. Selection on the basis of the numbers.</p>

<p class="textAbstract">4. Hybridization obtained in the third step of the chromosomes.</p>

<p class="textAbstract">5. The mutation.</p>

<p class="textAbstract"> 6. Go to the second step.</p>

<p class="textAbstract">7. The algorithm is interrupted after a predetermined number of iterations.</p>

<p class="TitleBio" id="titleThree">3 Evaluation of the complexity of algorithms</p>

<p class="textAbstract">Algorithm - a program that is a very calculating,
         often with no other items of computer - network problems or the user input and output.
         An analysis of the complexity of lets you know how fast the program when it makes the calculations.</p>

<p class="textAbstract">O () - "stripped-down" time evaluation algorithm, which is often much easier to obtain,
         what the exact formula for the number of operations.</p>

<p class="textAbstract">The following rules for the evaluation of O ():</p>

<p class="textAbstract">- In the evaluation of the function is taken over the number of operations that grows most rapidly;</p>

<p class="textAbstract">- In the evaluation of O () constants are not taken into account.</p>

<p class="textAbstract">The complexity of the table of the simplex method is mainly determined by the number of operands
         in the simplex table and is O (n).
         Graphical method as well as the method sipleks simple in terms of implementation and has an identical difficulty.</p>
